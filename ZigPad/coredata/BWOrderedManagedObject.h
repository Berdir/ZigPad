    @class       BWOrderedManagedObject
	
    @abstract    
	
	A subclass of NSManagedObject that provide support for imposing an ordering on to-many 
	relationships
    
	@discussion  
		
	By default, to-many Core Data relationships are unordered, but there are
	some cases where you want to impose a specific ordering on a relationship.  The
	classic example of this is iTunes, where each playlist can have a list of tracks,
	but those tracks can be put in a specific order by the user.
	
	BWOrderedManagedObject manages this by using an additional property to store the
	ordering for each relationship that you want to be ordered.  By default, the string
	"Ordering" is appended to the name of the relationship key to form the key that the
	ordering data is stored in (e.g. the ordering for the "tracks" relationship is stored
	under the key "tracksOrdering")
	
	BWOrderedManagedObject also provides a set of methods that allow for inserting, deleting,
	and rearranging objects in a specific order.

	By default, this method will compile a list of keys based on the entity definition of
	the object.  Any to-many relationship which has the corresponding ordering key also
	defined will be returned.  This method can be overridden if you want to use some other
	method of determining which of your relationships should be ordered.
